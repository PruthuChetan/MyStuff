<h1>How can I trust a website?</h1>
<p>In the ideal world there are many ways from which people can create a fake website. These are criminal websites and people can see your personal details and can hack to your bank account. If it is a “pal webpage” account, then it is a criminal website.It's not difficult for people with basic programming or design skills to create fake websites that look exactly like ones you often visit and trust. For example, a cybercriminal may duplicate a PayPal Web page, put it on the Web and wait for you to unwittingly enter your username and password. If you do that, the criminal can use that information to log in to your real PayPal account.</p>

<h2>What are the effects?</h2>
<p>They can Hack your stuff and can make you endangered by taking your personal stuff.There are billions of different websites on the internet. Anybody can set up a website and publish anything they want. Information on the internet isn't always true, so look out for the signs of an accurate website.The most reliable websites are often set up by official organisations and businesses. They can often be identified by their web address.</p>
<h3>How do I know that I am safe?</h3>
<p>Before you type your card details into a website, ensure that the site is secure. Look out for a small padlock symbol in the address bar (or elsewhere in your browser window) and a web address beginning with https:// (the s stands for 'secure'). You also need to check that the website is trustworthy. Click "Internet Options" followed by "Trusted Sites" and you can then click "Sites" to open the Trusted Sites window. Type the URL of a site you'd like to trust in the "Add This Website to the Zone" and then click "Add." IE adds the site to the Websites box. Add additional sites as needed using this method.
